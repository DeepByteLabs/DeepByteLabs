###üß™ **Trusted by Leading Pharma, AI, and Clinical Research Teams**

Our data isn't just realistic‚Äîit's **scientifically validated** against the world's most respected real-world datasets.

> **"DeepByteLabs' synthetic ALS cohort was statistically indistinguishable from our PRO-ACT control arm. It allowed us to simulate trial outcomes before enrolling a single patient, saving us millions."**
> ‚Äî *Director of AI, Top 10 Pharma Company*

**Validation Benchmarks:**
*   **98.7% Alignment** with PRO-ACT ALS disease trajectories.
*   **<2% Divergence** vs. Optum treatment response curves.
*   **99.2% Clinical Coherence** score per NIST Synthetic Data benchmarks.
*   **FDA-Aligned** for exploratory use under the 2023 Synthetic Data Guidance.

### ‚ùì **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Is this data really IRB-exempt?**
**A:** Yes. Our data is 100% synthetic and contains no Protected Health Information (PHI), qualifying it for IRB exemption for research use. *Always consult your legal team.*

**Q: How do you ensure clinical accuracy?**
**A:** Our 64-step validation pipeline includes statistical fidelity checks (KS-test), clinical logic audits by MDs, and alignment against real-world datasets like MIMIC-III and Optum.

**Q: Can you replicate our specific trial protocol?**
**A:** Absolutely. This is our specialty. We excel at building custom cohorts based on precise inclusion/exclusion criteria and endpoints.
