# DeepByteLabs — Sample Datasets

**NIH-Validated Synthetic Patient Data for Healthcare, Research & AI Development**

This repository serves as a **showcase of sample synthetic clinical datasets** generated using the [DeepByteLabs Temporal]. These samples demonstrate the accuracy, realism, and customization possible for clients in healthcare, research, and life sciences.

---

## 📊 What’s Inside

You’ll find synthetic datasets simulating real-world clinical profiles, conditions, and use cases, including:

- 🫀 **Cardiology Study Cohort** — age-stratified, medication-aware profiles  
- 🧬 **Rare Disease Simulation** — ALS progression samples  
- 🧒 **Pediatric Data** — samples from early developmental windows  
- 💉 **Lab + Medication History** — integrated longitudinal datasets  
- 🧠 **Neurodegenerative Disease Profiles** — for ML training/testing  
- 📁 Export formats: **FHIR**, **OMOP CDM**, **CSV**, **Parquet**

Each sample reflects the same high-fidelity generation pipeline used in clinical research, with anonymization layers and validation aligned to **NIH N3C**, **FDA**, and **HIPAA** standards.

## 🧪 Why Hybrid Synthetic?

**We don’t just fabricate data — we evolve it.**  
Our hybrid approach starts with the real world and builds upward, unlocking the best of both science and safety.

---

### 🧬 Built *from* Real, Made *for* Real

Rather than generating random synthetic records in isolation, we derive our models directly from **real-world clinical datasets** (RWD), such as:

- 🏥 Electronic Health Records (EHRs)  
- 💵 Claims and billing datasets  
- 📊 Clinical trials and registries  
- 🧪 Public datasets 

These foundations enable us to simulate **natural patient journeys** with all the richness of the real world — without compromising privacy.

---

### 🔒 Perfected Through Privacy-First Engineering

We use advanced statistical modeling, disease progression algorithms, and **cryptographic anonymization** to synthesize data that:

- ✅ Resembles real-world records in structure and behavior  
- 🔐 Contains **zero Protected Health Information (PHI)**  
- 🛡️ Passes **64 layers** of quality and safety validation  
- 🌍 Complies with **HIPAA, GDPR, and global standards**

---

### ⚖️ Why This Matters

Real-world data is powerful, but limited:

- 🚫 Access is restricted and delayed by compliance concerns  
- ❌ Many datasets are incomplete, inconsistent, or outdated  
- 🔐 PHI requires deep anonymization  
- 🧩 Rare conditions are underrepresented  

We bridge these limitations by **training on the real**, then **generating synthetic cohorts** that:

- 🔁 Reflect real-world comorbidities and disease progression  
- 🚀 Enable **instant, compliant use** in research, testing, AI, and demos
- 🧬 Fill in gaps (e.g., rare diseases, underrepresented groups, Longitudinal Depth)

---

### 🎯 Clinically Convincing. Ethically Safe.

> *“Synthetic data that thinks like a patient and protects like a firewall.”*

With every record, you're not just getting data — you're getting:

- 📈 Real-world derived distributions  
- 🧠 Medically sound trajectories  
- 🎛️ Adjustable demographics, medications, outcomes  
- 🔐 Zero compromise on privacy or ethics

---

## 🔍 Use Cases

- AI/ML model prototyping for EHR data  
- Clinical trial simulations & control arms  
- Healthcare software testing  
- Research without IRB restrictions  
- Rare disease biomarker discovery 
- HealthTech device validation

## 🔐 Compliance, Validation & Trust

All datasets generated via the Clinical Data Generator undergo a rigorous privacy-first process, ensuring compliance, clinical realism, and operational readiness.

- ✅ **NIH N3C Benchmarked** — clinically validated against national standards (≥ 98.7% consistency)  
- ✅ **HIPAA & GDPR Compliant** — contains zero PHI, fully safe for global use  
- ✅ **IRB-Exempt by Design** — synthetic data is not subject to human subject research rules  
- ✅ **64-Stage Quality & Safety Pipeline** — including unit tests, statistical drift checks, and provenance chains  
- ✅ **HITRUST-Ready Infrastructure** — supports SOC2 Type 2, ISO 27001, and secure data exchange  
- ✅ **Cryptographic Anonymization** — built-in HMAC-SHA256 for ID generation + audit trails  
- ✅ **Built on Real-World Clinical Patterns** — with hybrid modeling for realism, compliance, and control  

> 🧬 Our data reflects reality, not identities.

Our system goes beyond surface-level simulation by incorporating **real-world-inspired metadata** such as:
- ZIP-level demographics  
- Regionally accurate disease prevalence  
- Wearable device signals (e.g., heart rate, steps, sleep patterns)  
- Social determinants of health (e.g., income brackets, neighborhood health indices)

Yet every output remains **fully synthetic**, **non-identifiable**, and **safe for use across borders and applications**.
