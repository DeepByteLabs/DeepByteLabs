# Clinical Data Generator — Sample Datasets

**NIH-Validated Synthetic Patient Data for Healthcare, Research & AI Development**

This repository serves as a **showcase of sample synthetic clinical datasets** generated using the [Clinical Data Generator](https://github.com/your-org/clinical-data-generator). These samples demonstrate the accuracy, realism, and customization possible for clients in healthcare, research, and life sciences.

---

## 📊 What’s Inside

You’ll find synthetic datasets simulating real-world clinical profiles, conditions, and use cases, including:

- 🫀 **Cardiology Study Cohort** — age-stratified, medication-aware profiles  
- 🧬 **Rare Disease Simulation** — ALS progression samples  
- 🧒 **Pediatric Data** — samples from early developmental windows  
- 💉 **Lab + Medication History** — integrated longitudinal datasets  
- 🧠 **Neurodegenerative Disease Profiles** — for ML training/testing  
- 📁 Export formats: **FHIR**, **OMOP CDM**, **CSV**, **Parquet**

Each sample reflects the same high-fidelity generation pipeline used in clinical research, with anonymization layers and validation aligned to **NIH N3C**, **FDA**, and **HIPAA** standards.

## 🧪 Why Synthetic?

Synthetic patient data offers the following advantages:

- ✅ No PHI — fully privacy-compliant (HIPAA, GDPR)
- 🚀 Ready to use — for AI/ML model development, validation, or demos
- 🧠 Clinically accurate — based on NIH datasets, FDA-cleared curves
- 🔁 Customizable — by condition, demographics, medications, biomarkers

---

## 🔍 Use Cases

- AI/ML model prototyping for EHR data  
- Clinical trial simulations & control arms  
- Healthcare software testing  
- Research without IRB restrictions  
- Educational tools & analytics training  

---

## 📦 How to Access

Sample files are available in this repository under the `/datasets` directory. Formats include:

- `.csv`  
- `.parquet`  
- `.json` (FHIR bundles)
